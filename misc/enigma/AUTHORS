This implementation of crypt, named enigma, was taken from the public
domain Crypt Breaker's Workbench software by Joerg Wunsch.

Modifications have been made by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory and
the BRL-CAD open source project in support of 64-bit compilation,
compilation warnings, and the provided build system.
