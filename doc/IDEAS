Ideas for new BRL-CAD contributors
==================================

If someone is interested in contributing to BRL-CAD and doesn't have
an idea of where to begin, included below is a list of ideas of
interest for people to work on.  Each idea has been given a value
between 0 and 9 as a broad indicator of the difficulty and a rough
relative estimate of the expected time involved.
