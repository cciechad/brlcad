BRL-CAD on Linux README
=======================

Below are installation and platform notes of relevance to particular
Linux distributions.

Table of Contents

Arch Linux
Ubuntu
PPC64 Linux


Arch Linux
----------

An example PKGBUILD and needed scripts are provided in misc/archlinux.
Review and edit the PKGBUILD to suit your preferred configuration and
build situation (eg. building from a tarball vs building from SVN).
Run `makepkg` in that directory to build the package.


Ubuntu
------

Users of Ubuntu and other similar packaging distributions of Linux
will need to ensure that a few essentials are in place before you will
be able to compile BRL-CAD.

Following the build instructions in the INSTALL file, if you are
starting from configure then you will need:

gcc (3+, e.g. 4.0.3)
make (e.g. gnu make 3.8.0)

If you are starting from autogen.sh you will need a few additional
tools that comprise the GNU Autotool toolset:

autoconf (2.50+, e.g. 2.59)
automake (1.6+, e.g. 1.9)
libtool (1.4+, e.g. 1.5)

All three of those have implicit dependencies on things like m4, perl,
cpp, and more.

If you installed automake version 1.4, you will need to install 1.9
and update the alternatives entry for automake so that it refers to
version 1.9 and not version 1.4:

sudo update-alternatives automake /usr/bin/automake-1.9


PPC64 Linux
-----------

If you happen to be installing on a ppc64 Linux system, the binaries
will not correctly resolve without being installed first.  Be sure to
install before testing applications.
