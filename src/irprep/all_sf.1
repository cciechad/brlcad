.SH NAME
all_sf \- obtain shape factors between named regions of an entire mged database
.SH SYNOPSIS
all_sf model.g objects...
.SH DESCRIPTIONS
all_sf
is an interactive program used to create a file containing shape
factors between all regions of the named objects.  The shape factor
from region i to region j is the fraction of total energy radiated
from region i that is intercepted by region j.  This program finds
the shapefactors for all regions in an mged model not just shapefactors
between engine regions.
.sp
All_sf uses a Monte Carlo simulation, so increasing the number of
significant digits in the answer by one requires about one hundred
fold increase in the number of rays fired.
.sp
Three different files are created by all_sf; an output file, a longwave
radiation exchange file, and an error file.  The output file lists the
shapefactors between each region.  The longwave radiation exchange
file is for use with PRISM.  This file is not quite PRISM ready so the
user must fill in the missing parameters if it is to be used with
PRISM.  The error file is basically used for checking errors in the
program and probably will not be used by the average user.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is an example from an interactive session.
.nf
