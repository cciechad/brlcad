Legend:
==========================
* Completed
. In Progress
- Needs looking into


Version:	0.2.6
Date:		02-21-2004
==========================
. Animated Background
. Animated Shaders
. Fog (Beers Law)
. Clouds Shader has Absolute coordinate system option
. Added <mix> and <anim> shaders
. Scene points to shader instead of unique <background> now
- Smooth Shading (Subdivide Mesh AND average normals?)


Version:	0.2.5
Date:		02-21-2004
==========================
* Implemented Badouel/Wald Triangle Algorithm
* Migrated Octree to a BSP using Walds 8-byte BSP nodes
* Made significant optimizations to BSP including one-hit, 2x speedup here
* Merged BoundingBox check into intersection algorithm (10% faster)
* Modifications to BLRT and Layout of Data files to make more robust
* Binary Format (Loading about ~3x faster)


Version:	0.2.4
Date:		12-01-2003
==========================
* Commented out Draw.Draw() in several areas of BLRT to improve performance
* Bump Shader has 3 parameters (x,y,z) instead of 1
* Fixed Anim Crash Bug
* Pixels rendered to SDL_Surface now
* BMP utility replaced by SDL's BMP utilities
* Rendering now displays on a per pass basis
* Added Transparency Shader
* Removed ADRT.cxx, Migrated into Scene.cxx and Camera.cxx
* Minor performance improvements in Box, Octree, and Triangle
* Fixed Matrix Inversion

Version:	0.2.3
Date:		11-20-2003
==========================
* Improved Phong Lights (Energy Divided among Mesh)
* Precomputed Matrix Inverse for Mesh
* Fixed Special Case for Orthogonal Inverted Matrix (Transpose)
* Fixed Reflections in Phong
* Transformations take place in Triangle now
* Added background color to scene file <background r="" g="" b="">
* Added Curses Console Display
* A "-g" parameter must now be issued for graphical display of rendering
* Improved efficiency of Octree (~10%) in Prep phase and render phase, removed unnecessary computations


Version:	0.2.2
Date		11-14-2003
==========================
* Reflections Added to Phong
* Animations work, parser bug with ASCII 13,10 handling
* Added Scale and Translate to clouds shader
* Fixed Checker Shader on Edges
* Added relative paths to file parser (no need to be in that directory)
* BLRT updated to choose what to export (mesh, frame, shader, etc)


Version:	0.2.1
Date		11-12-2003
==========================
* Entire Prep phase 60% faster (optimized octree, parsing)
* Support for Background Color with <background r="" g="" b=""> tag
* Python Script now has GUI
* Added Light Objects Class and <light pos="" dir="" col="" energy="" type=""> tag in shader


Version:	0.2.0
Date		11-09-2003
==========================
* Parsing Engine ~20x faster (Added Buffered Read)
* Smooth Normal Tolerance Added
* Fixed Edge BBox Problem
* Perlin Noise
. Turbulence
* Blend Shader (Red Channel Used)
* Bump Shader
* Camo Shader
* Checker Shader
* Clouds Shader (Perlin)
. Wood Shader (Turbulence)
- Matrix Inversion
